# Reducing-Telecom-Customer-Churn-A-Six-Sigma-Approach

# Telco Customer Churn Analysis

This project explores why customers leave a telecommunications company and offers practical solutions to help keep them. Using a real-world dataset and the Six Sigma DMAIC approach, we break down the problem, find what causes customers to leave, and suggest steps to improve retention.

# About

- **Goal:** Reduce the number of customers leaving by 20% within a year.

  Analyze customer data to uncover main reasons for churn and take targeted actions.

# Approach

1. **Define:** Clearly state the problem—too many customers are leaving, affecting the company’s bottom line.
2. **Measure:** Use sample data of 1,000 real customers to find out how big the problem is.
3. **Analyze:** Dive deeper to identify patterns—Who is leaving and why?
4. **Improve:** Suggest changes based on data insights.
5. **Control:** Make sure improvements stick by monitoring and reviewing regularly.

# points 

- **Who’s at Risk:** Customers with monthly contracts and those paying higher bills are much more likely to leave.
- **Why Is that :** These customers add significant revenue, so their loss has a big impact.
- **What Data Shows:** Month-to-month contract holders and new customers are at the highest risk. People paying more each month also leave at a higher rate.

# recommendations

- **Encourage Long-Term Contracts:** Offer discounts and special deals to make longer contracts more attractive.
- **Better Onboarding:** Help new customers get started and feel valued, especially during their first month.
- **Flexible Pricing:** Let high-paying customers adjust their plans easily, and reward loyalty to make them feel appreciated.
- **Ongoing Monitoring:** Use dashboards and alerts to quickly spot problems. Hold quarterly reviews to keep improving.

# Dataset

- Telco Customer Churn dataset from Kaggle, which includes information such as contract type, monthly charges, and whether a customer has left the service.

This analysis gives a clear, actionable roadmap to help telecom companies understand—and fix—customer churn using data-driven strategies. The focus is on real solutions that can make a measurable impact in keeping customers loyal.

# Conclusion

Our project took a real-world look at why customers leave a telecom company and what we can actually do about it, using a step-by-step, structured approach. By digging into the data, we found that the customers most likely to leave have short contracts and pay higher monthly bills. That’s a red flag—not just in numbers, but in lost relationships and future revenue.

Instead of guessing, we used data visualizations and tests to back up what we saw. We then suggested solutions that aren’t just theory , they’re based on what’s been proven to work elsewhere. These include making long-term contracts more appealing, giving new customers a better start, and making pricing more flexible, especially for those who spend more.

we weren’t able to use every possible detail—like how the company’s day-to-day operations work or exactly how happy customers feel , because that information wasn’t available in the dataset. But what we do have is a solid, practical plan. If these strategies are put into action and managed well, the company stands a real chance of hitting its goal of cutting churn by 20% within one year. This isn’t just about plugging a hole , it’s about building lasting relationships and a healthier business for the future.
